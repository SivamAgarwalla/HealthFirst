# HealthFirst
A health app that will allow users that are feeling sick to record and track symptoms and general sentiment for the day. The recordings will be done via voice, and then converted to text. Users be able to see past recordings along with the text, and will be able to fill out quick forms after each recording so the system can get a better idea how they are feeling. Additionally, the app will run analysis algorithms on the users data to determine the severity of this condition. This analysis can be will be used in two main ways:

* To create a prioritization algorithm that will rank the users on the system based on the severity of condition. The reasoning for this is that a spike in COVID-19 has made medical attention much sparser and harder for most to get. Ranking the users would allow doctors/medical centers better determine who needs care. Not only would they be able to see the rankings, but the analysis summary for each user would allow them to quickly determine who needs care.
* If the patient's condition is increasing in severity then we can connect them with a doctor to monitor their status, because COVID-19 has made it much riskier to patients to go the hospital. Converting the speak to text, and providing an updating summary on how the user is doing would make it faster for the doctor to review how they are doing and prescribe them appropriately.
